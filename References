Placement: <link> elements should be placed inside the <head> section, not the <body>.
Order: Place critical CSS links early in the <head> to avoid "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC), where the page loads without style before rendering.
Self-Closing: In modern HTML5, a trailing slash is not required, but <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> is standard, while XHTML requires <link />.
